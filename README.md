# Event-Manager
Php based event manager back end.

## Overview
A basic event management app to track event venues in Malta. 
Before registering venues, the app will be used to populate and manage the list of cities and venue categories.


### Description;
- The user should be able to list, add, edit and delete cities and categories.
- Categories can have multi-level infinite subcategories.
- Events need to be assigned to one city.
- Events can be classified with multiple categories.
- Every action should be driven by an API you created.


## Instructions

```
docker-compose up -d
```

- Setup up nginx server
- Sets up php-fpm and runs composer to manage dependencies
- Sets up redis.
